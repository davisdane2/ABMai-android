ðŸ“¦ **Commit**: `7c736d5` - "Implement complete Android project structure with Jetpack Compose"
ðŸ”— **Repository**: https://github.com/davisdane2/ABMai-android

## What's Been Completed on Linux

### âœ… Full Android Project Setup

- Data models ported from iOS Swift to Kotlin
- Glassmorphic UI with animations
- WebView integration with lifecycle management

## Why macOS?

From NOTES.md:
> **Reason:** To fully utilize the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin in Android Studio for targeting iOS, a Mac is required. The necessary tools for building and testing on iOS (like Xcode and its command-line tools) are only available on macOS.
