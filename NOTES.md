# ABMai-android Development Notes

## Project Status
- The initial Gradle build setup is complete.
- Corrected an issue with the Kotlin Compose plugin ID in `build.gradle.kts`.

## Next Steps: Platform Migration
**Action Item:** We need to move development to a macOS environment.

**Reason:** To fully utilize the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin in Android Studio for targeting iOS, a Mac is required. The necessary tools for building and testing on iOS (like Xcode and its command-line tools) are only available on macOS.
