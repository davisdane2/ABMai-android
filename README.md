## üöß Project Status

**This repository is in the initial setup phase for Android migration.**

The original iOS application has been successfully deployed on TestFlight and is now being adapted for Android. This repository contains the source code foundation from the iOS version that will be transformed into a native Android application.

### Migration Plan

**Phase 1: Repository Setup** ‚úÖ
- [x] Create ABMai-android repository
- [x] Copy source files from iOS version
- [x] Remove iOS-specific files and configurations
- [x] Prepare project structure for Android development

**Phase 2: Android Project Setup** (In Progress)
- [ ] Create Android Studio project structure
- [ ] Set up Kotlin/Java project with Jetpack Compose
- [ ] Configure Gradle build system
- [ ] Establish Material Design 3 UI framework
- [ ] Port glassmorphic design concepts to Android

**Phase 3: Core Functionality Migration**
- [ ] Migrate dashboard categories and data models
- [ ] Implement WebView for HTML dashboard rendering
- [ ] Port Supabase database connectivity
- [ ] Recreate navigation and routing system
- [ ] Adapt UI components to Material Design

**Phase 4: Feature Parity**
- [ ] Migrate all 13 operational dashboards
- [ ] Implement AI-powered tools (Concrete Quote AI, Mix Design Assist)
- [ ] Port CHASCOmobile VPN integration
- [ ] Add Android-specific features (Android Auto, widgets, etc.)

**Phase 5: Testing & Distribution**
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across Android devices
- [ ] Google Play Store preparation
- [ ] Beta distribution via Play Store internal testing
- [ ] Production release

## üé® Design Philosophy

The Android version will adapt the glassmorphic design language from iOS while embracing Material Design 3 principles:

- **Material You Theming** - Dynamic color adaptation
- **Glassmorphic Elements** - Frosted glass effects using blur and transparency
- **Modern Animations** - Smooth transitions and spring-based interactions
- **Adaptive Layouts** - Support for phones, tablets, and foldables
- **Dark Mode Support** - System-wide dark theme integration

---

## üîß Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture:** MVVM with Kotlin Coroutines
- **Database Client:** Supabase Kotlin SDK
- **WebView:** Android WebView for dashboard rendering
- **Network:** Ktor or Retrofit for API calls
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Build System:** Gradle with Kotlin DSL

---

## üì± Platform Support

- **Minimum Android Version:** Android 8.0 (API 26)
- **Target Android Version:** Android 14 (API 34)
- **Device Support:** Phones, Tablets, Foldables
- **Android Auto Support:** Planned for future releases

---

## üîê Security & Database

The app will connect to the same Supabase PostgreSQL database as the iOS version:
- **Authentication:** Will implement proper authentication (upgrading from anonymous)
- **Row Level Security:** Full RLS implementation for production
- **VPN Integration:** Secure connection to plant control systems

## üìñ Source Material

This Android port is based on **ABM.ai for iOS v1.4 Beta**, which includes:
- 13 operational dashboards
- Glassmorphic UI design
- AI-powered tools
- CHASCOmobile VPN integration
- TestFlight beta distribution

Original iOS repository: https://github.com/davisdane2/ABMai

## üìù Development Notes

The `Dane/` directory contains the Swift source files from the iOS application for reference during migration:
- `ContentView.swift` - Main UI implementation
- `Dashboard.swift` - Dashboard data models
- `DashboardWebView.swift` - WebView integration
- `Constants.swift` - App configuration
- `DashboardAssets/` - HTML dashboard files

These files serve as the blueprint for the Android implementation and will be gradually replaced with Kotlin/Compose equivalents.
